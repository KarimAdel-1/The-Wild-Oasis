# üè® The Wild Oasis - Hotel Management System

This project is an internal application built for **The Wild Oasis**, a small boutique hotel featuring eight luxurious wooden cabins. The app is designed to help hotel staff manage all hotel operations, including bookings, cabins, guests, and check-ins/check-outs. It is also the back-office management tool for the hotel, eventually working alongside a future customer-facing website for bookings.
